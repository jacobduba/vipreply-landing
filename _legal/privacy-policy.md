# Privacy policy

*Last updated: May 21, 2025*

Your data belongs to you. We only use it to provide and improve our service. In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights with respect to your data. We promise we never sell your data: never have, never will.

This policy is split into sections. For your convenience, links to each of those sections is as follows:

* [Privacy policy](#privacy-policy)
* [What we collect and why](#what-we-collect-and-why)
* [When we access or disclose your information](#when-we-access-or-disclose-your-information)
* [Third-party compliance](#third-party-compliance)
* [Your rights with respect to your information](#your-rights-with-respect-to-your-information)
* [How we secure your data](#how-we-secure-your-data)
* [What happens when you delete content in your product accounts](#what-happens-when-you-delete-content-in-your-product-accounts)
* [Data retention](#data-retention)
* [Location of site and data](#location-of-site-and-data)
* [Questions](#questions)

This policy applies to VIPReply, operated by VIPReply, LLC.

This policy applies to our handling of information about site visitors, prospective customers, and customers and authorized users (in relation to their procurement of the services and management of their relationship with VIPReply). We refer collectively to these categories of individuals as "you" throughout this policy.

However, this policy does not cover information about a customer's end users that VIPReply receives from a customer, or otherwise processes on a customer's behalf, in connection with the services provided by VIPReply to the customer pursuant to an applicable services agreement (including the content of messages of customer end users ("End User Communications")). VIPReply processes End User Communications under the instructions of the relevant customer, which is the "data controller" or "business" (or occupies a similar role as defined in applicable privacy laws), as described in the applicable services agreement between such customer and VIPReply. VIPReply's obligations as a "data processor" or "service provider" with respect to such information are defined in such services agreement and applicable data protection addendum and are not made part of this policy.

If you are a customer's end user and you have questions about how your information is collected and processed through the services, please contact the organization who has provided your information to us for more information.

## What we collect and why

Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need to provide and improve our service. Here's what that means in practice:

### Identity and access

When you sign in with Google, we automatically collect certain information from your Google account, such as your name, email address, and profile picture, as authorized by your Google account settings. This information allows us to create and personalize your VIPReply account without requiring manual input. We use this data to streamline your onboarding experience, send essential product updates, and, with your consent, provide optional communications like newsletters and surveys.

We'll never sell your personal information to third parties, and we won't use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission either.

### Billing information

If you subscribe to VIPReply, you will be asked to provide your payment information and billing address. Credit card information is submitted directly to our payment processor and doesn't hit VIPReply's servers. We store a record of the payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card number, for purposes of account history, invoicing, and billing support. We store your billing address so we can charge you for service, calculate any sales tax due, send you invoices, and detect fraudulent credit card transactions. We occasionally use aggregate billing information to guide our marketing efforts.

### Product interactions

We store on our servers the content that you upload or receive or maintain in your VipReply account. This includes any data you directly upload to VIPReply as well as Gmail data when you connect your Gmail account.

When you choose to connect your Gmail account to VIPReply, we import up to 100 of your most recent emails from the past 60 days and any new emails while your account is connected. We store a copy of your Gmail threads, messages, and attachments on our servers. This Gmail data is necessary to provide our core services, including generating AI-powered email replies and managing your inbox through VIPReply. We only access and store Gmail data for accounts that you explicitly connect to our service.

We keep this content as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we'll delete the content within 60 days.

### General Geolocation data

For most of our products, we log the full IP address used to sign up a product account and retain that for use in mitigating future spammy signups. We also log all account access by full IP address for security and fraud prevention purposes, and we keep this login data for as long as your product account is active.

### Website interactions

We collect information about your browsing activity for analytics and statistical purposes such as conversion rate testing and experimenting with new product designs. This includes, for example, your browser and operating system versions, your IP address, which web pages you visited and how long they took to load, and which website referred you to us. If you have an account and are signed in, these web analytics data are tied to your IP address and user account until your account is no longer active. The web analytics we use are described further in the Advertising and Cookies section.

### Anti-bot assessments

We may use [CAPTCHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) across our applications to mitigate brute force logins and as a means of spam protection. We have a legitimate interest in protecting our apps and the broader Internet community from credential stuffing attacks and spam. When you log into your VIPReply account and when you fill in certain forms, the CAPTCHA service evaluates various information (e.g., IP address, how long the visitor has been on the app, mouse movements) to try to detect if the activity is from an automated program instead of a human. The CAPTCHA service then provides VIPReply with the spam score results; we do not have access to the evaluated information.

### Advertising and Cookies

VIPReply runs contextual ads on various third-party platforms such as Google, Reddit, and LinkedIn. Users who click on one of our ads will be sent to the VIPReply marketing site. Where permissible under law, we may load an ad-company script on their browsers that sets a third-party cookie and sends information to the ad network to enable evaluation of the effectiveness of our ads, e.g., which ad they clicked and which keyword triggered the ad, and whether they performed certain actions such as clicking a button or submitting a form.

We also use persistent first-party cookies and some third-party cookies to store certain preferences, make it easier for you to use our applications, and perform A/B testing as well as support some analytics.

A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser. It may help remember login information and site preferences. It might also collect information such as your browser type, operating system, web pages visited, duration of visit, content viewed, and other click-stream data. You can adjust cookie retention settings and accept or block individual cookies in your browser settings, although our apps won't work and other aspects of our service may not function properly if you turn cookies off.

### Voluntary correspondence

When you email VIPReply with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including your email address, so that we have a history of past correspondence to reference if you reach out in the future.

We also store information you may volunteer, for example, written responses to surveys. If you agree to a customer interview, we may ask for your permission to record the conversation for future reference or use. We will only do so with your express consent.

## When we access or disclose your information

**To provide products or services you've requested**: We use a number of third-party subprocessors to help run our applications and provide Services to you. These subprocessors support essential functionality such as AI processing, error tracking, analytics, and integration with your Gmail account. Below is a list of third-party processors we currently use at VIPReply:

- **DigitalOcean**: for hosting our infrastructure.
- **Cloudflare**: for DNS management and CDN services.
- **OpenRouter**: for AI model access to generate text embeddings and personalized email replies.
  - We use the providers listed for the embedding model here: https://openrouter.ai/qwen/qwen3-embedding-8b.
  - We use OpenAI for LLM generation.
- **Google**: for OAuth authentication, fetching Gmail messages and attachments when you connect your inbox, and delivering web fonts to your browser.
- **Honeybadger**: for application error monitoring and reporting.
- **PostHog**: for product analytics and usage tracking.

Most of our third-party processors only temporarily process your data and do not store it. Only DigitalOcean (our infrastructure host) stores your actual data. PostHog retains only analytics and event tracking data (user actions, feature usage) but does not receive email content or other sensitive personal information. Honeybadger retains error data (which may include email content if errors occur during email processing) for 15 days for debugging and monitoring purposes, after which it is automatically deleted. AI providers (OpenRouter, which routes to the embedding providers listed above and to OpenAI for LLM generation) process your data in real-time to generate responses but do not store, retain, or train on your information.

**We do not transfer or disclose your information to third parties for purposes other than the ones provided**: We only share the minimum necessary data with these processors and use them to improve your experience with our products and services.

**To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug**: When errors occur in our application, we will access and review the relevant parts of your data that are causing the error to diagnose and resolve issues. This helps us maintain service reliability and improve our product.

**To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding restricted uses**: Accessing a customer's account when investigating potential abuse is a measure of last resort. We want to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the people reporting issues to us, and we do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process. If we discover you are using our products for a restricted purpose, we will take action as necessary, including notifying appropriate authorities where warranted.

**Aggregated and de-identified data**: We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected through the services. We may use de-identified or aggregated data for any purpose, including marketing or analytics.

**When required under applicable law**: All data infrastructure are located in the U.S.

* Requests for user data. Our policy is to not respond to government requests for user data unless we are compelled by legal process or in limited circumstances in the event of an emergency request. However, if U.S. law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring us to disclose data, we must comply. Likewise, we will only respond to requests from government authorities outside the U.S. if compelled by the U.S. government through procedures outlined in a mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement. It is VIPReply policy to notify affected users before we disclose data unless we are legally prohibited from doing so, and except in some emergency cases.

* Preservation requests. Similarly, VIPReply policy is to comply with requests to preserve data only if compelled by the U.S. Federal Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(f), or by a properly served U.S. subpoena for civil matters. We do not disclose preserved data unless required by law or compelled by a court order that we choose not to appeal. Furthermore, unless we receive a proper warrant, court order, or subpoena before the required preservation period expires, we will destroy any preserved copies of customer data at the end of the preservation period.

* If we are audited by a tax authority, we may be required to disclose billing-related information. If that happens, we will disclose only the minimum needed, such as billing addresses and tax exemption information.

Finally, if VIPReply is acquired by or merges with another company — we don't plan on that, but if it happens — we'll notify you well before any of your personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

## Third-party compliance

Our use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the [Limited Use requirements](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#limited-use).

Google Workspace data will only be used to train personalized AI/ML models. In other words, no Google Workspace data will be used to develop, improve, or train generalized AI/ML models.

## Your rights with respect to your information

At VIPReply, we strive to apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Some of these rights include:

* **Right to Know.** You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.
* **Right of Access.** This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.
* **Right to Correction.** You have the right to request correction of your personal information.
* **Right to Erasure / "To Be Forgotten".** This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, from all of our service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using VIPReply services because our applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.
* **Right to Complain.** You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority.
* **Right to Restrict Processing.** This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of your personal information. (Again: we never have and never will sell your personal data.)
* **Right to Object.** You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.
* **Right to not Be Subject to Automated Decision-Making.** You have the right to object to and prevent any decision that could have a legal or similarly significant effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.
* **Right to Non-Discrimination.** We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.

Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and updating your account information. Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need to retain certain information in order to provide our services to you.

In some cases, we also need to take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request, which may include, at a minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying your name and email address. If we are unable to verify you, we may be unable to respond to your requests. If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at [hello@vipreply.ai](mailto:hello@vipreply.ai). If an authorized agent is corresponding on your behalf, we will need written consent with a signature from the account holder before proceeding.

Depending on applicable law, you may have the right to appeal our decision to deny your request, if applicable. We will provide information about how to exercise that right in our response denying the request. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. If you are in the EU or UK, you can contact your data protection authority to file a complaint or learn more about local privacy laws.

## How we secure your data

All data is encrypted via [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) when transmitted from our servers to your browser. The database backups are also encrypted. In addition, we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest.

## What happens when you delete content in your product accounts

In many of our applications, we give you the option to trash content. Anything you trash in your product accounts while they are active will be kept in an accessible trash can for about 25 days (it varies a little by product). After that time, the trashed content cannot be accessed via the application and we are not able to retrieve it for you. The trashed content may remain on our active servers for another 30 days, and copies of the content may be held in backups of our application databases for up to another 30 days after that. Altogether, any content trashed in your product accounts should be purged from all of our systems and logs within 90 days.

If you choose to cancel your account, your content will become immediately inaccessible and should be purged from our systems in full within 60 days. This applies both for cases when an account owner directly cancels and for auto-canceled accounts.

## Data retention

We keep your information for the time necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and your choices, after which time we may delete and/or aggregate it. We may also retain and use this information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Through this policy, we have provided specific retention periods for certain types of information.

## Location of site and data

Our products and other web properties are operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union, UK, or elsewhere outside of the United States, **please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in the United States**. By using our websites or Services and/or providing us with your personal information, you consent to this transfer.
